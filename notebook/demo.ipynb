      "complaint_what_happened Was attracted to Citi 's promotional credit card deal involving 0 % APR for balance transfers and applied, was accepted, but never received a physical card in the mail. Applied in late XX/XX/2023, and called in mid-XXXX  to check on the status. It was told to me that the card was sent to the wrong address and that a new card would be sent and provided and confirmed the correct address. Since my address is in the US and is a XXXX XXXX , I was very clear on which delivery method is used as a physical address would be needed for 3rd party sends. After that long hold, multiple transfers, the same result no card. Unable to set up an online account to make payments without a 16-digit number I now have payment due and no way to get online to pay. Another call in mid-XXXX, this one 2 hours and 10 minutes just to get assistance to log on to pay. Transferred 4 times, explaining the same situation, made an online payment to ensure not late, and still have no access to an online account and was told that I would need to call in monthly payments. Is this a way to make paying harder to receive more revenue through late fees?? Shocking the lack of assistance here with no clear solution.\n",

      "Penn Credit Corporation responded over a full month later by sending me two pieces of mail, received by me on XX/XX/2023. One letter was accusing me of not responding of attempting to evade a what they called a \" just debt '' without further explanation, and the other actually acknowledged that Penn Credit Corporation had in fact received the response letter I sent on XX/XX/2023, and that they had completed verification of the alleged debt but declined to elaborate further nor answer any questions that I had sent to understand the nature, amount, relevant dates, and other fundamental information about the debt they are seeking to collect from me. Importantly, the first of these two letters, which also includes a Request for Payment, flagrantly and unfairly misrepresents that I did not attempt to contact Penn Credit Corporation ( I in fact did, by certified mail, and this outreach is attached ). These two response letters from Penn Credit Corporation ( separate pieces of mail ) were received by me on XX/XX/2023. Copies of these two separate letters are attached as the files titled \" From PCC 2 '' and \" From PCC 3 ''. For the avoidance of doubt, no further correspondence or information has been sent to me by Penn Credit Corporation despite my good faith requests for further information sent over a month ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings us to today and the reason why I am seeking assistance and clarification from the CFPB. In response to these two simultaneous and seemingly contradictory letters from Penn Credit Corporation, I sent a follow-up letter again ( today, XX/XX/2023 ) asking for information and re-enclosing those same questions as seen in the original attachment \" PCC Response 1 ''. However, in under a day from my receipt of these last unhelpful letters from Penn Credit Corporation, I was notified by a credit monitoring service I use, XXXX XXXX, that Penn Credit Corporation had unilaterally filed a collection account against me through XXXX. This credit alert notification also was received on XX/XX/2023. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am seeking your assistance because Penn Credit Corporation has improperly inflicted irreparable damage to my credit score while ignoring my rightful requests for information ( specifically, information of the type that the CFPB 's website recommends one should seek when contacted by debt collectors ). I am also seeking the CFPB 's assistance in also reversing/removing the collection account black mark placed on my personal credit report by Penn Credit Corporation . Lastly, I would also like to offer to put forward whatever info is needed to have Penn Credit Corporation 's debt collection licenses revoked/marked ( should they exist in the first place as Penn Credit Corporation did not respond to my requests that they verify the relevant license info, as clearly requested in the attached letter I sent on XX/XX/2023 ) -- to prevent similar irresponsible behavior from also impacting other American consumers in the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "And if you can assist and help clarify for me, I would also like to understand from the CFPB whether or not it is normal course or at all permissible for ( purportedly ) licensed debt collectors to unilaterally place collections accounts on an individual 's credit report while the debt is under dispute, as Penn Credit Corporation has done in the past few days in my case. For the avoidance of doubt again, I did notify Penn Credit Corporation that the alleged debt should be treated as under dispute, and I still consider it to be under dispute at this time.\n",

      "As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), Section 1681e, creditors have a duty to provide accurate information, but in my case, XXXX XXXX failed to do so. They also violated Section 1681i, which requires them to correct and investigate inaccuracies, and Section 1681s-2, which outlines their duties as furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, XXXX XXXX violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) by engaging in false or misleading representations ( Section 807 ) and unfair practices ( Section 808 ). They also failed to validate my debts, which is a violation of Section 809.\n",

      "Additionally, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) Section 312 requires the accuracy of consumer report information, and XXXX XXXX failed to comply with this provision.

For instance, TransUnion and XXXX reported a high credit of {$600.00}, while XXXX reported {$0.00}. Additionally, TransUnion and XXXX reported a credit limit of {$300.00}, but XXXX reported {$0.00}. This inconsistency has caused confusion and frustration for me, and I believe it violates Section 1681e of the FCRA, which requires creditors to provide accurate information to credit reporting agencies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, TransUnion reported a Last Reported date of XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX reported XX/XX/XXXX. This discrepancy also violates the FCRA, specifically Section 1681i, which requires creditors to investigate and correct any inaccuracies found in a credit report. \n",

'' These conflicting reports not only violate Section 1681e but also Section 1681g, which outlines the specific information that should be included in a consumer report. \n",

As a result of this negative information, I have been denied credit, including a car loan and a mortgage, which has prevented me from achieving my personal and financial goals. Additionally, the constant stress and anxiety caused by this situation have taken a toll on my mental health, affecting my relationships and ability to work effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX According to TransUnion XXXX XXXX, the account type was listed as a loan, but XXXX did not report this information. Additionally, TransUnion reported that the date opened was XX/XX/XXXX, while XXXX and XXXX listed it as XX/XX/XXXX. TransUnion also reported a high credit of {$880.00}, while XXXX listed it as {$660.00}, and XXXX reported {$870.00}.

      "According to TransUnion, the account was charged off as bad debt, a profit and loss write-off, while the other two bureaus reported it as an unpaid balance reported as a loss by the credit grantor, and a charged-off account amount in high credit original charge-off amount. \n",

TransUnion and XXXX report the account as an auto loan, but XXXX does not report it at all. Additionally, there are differences in the dates opened and the amounts past due reported by the different agencies. \n",

This notice should include the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor, and a statement explaining my rights to dispute the debt. \n",

If the information can not be verified or is found to be inaccurate, the credit reporting agency must promptly delete or modify the information.\n",

I have complained more than 88 times nonstop this is exhausting im depressed they are not putting these fraudulent inquiries in dispute and accounts and they still haven't deleted them either I am depressed. The problem has not been resolved. my fico has me at a credit score over 709 transunion has me at a score around 590. That is a huge difference. transunion paints me as a Bum. my fico say I have good credit. What the heck is going on here. i have almost no debt and my identity was stolen causing my score to drop n i made this clear for 90 days straight with transunion i spoke to a representative agent name XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX from the fraud department I prefer to speak to a us rept but they refused they had me on mute for 4 hours which was hurtful I have a perfect repayment record. I have very low credit utilization. I have one negative credit items outstanding debt now that is not mines. I have modest but ok income. Social Security. Something is wrong with Transunion. I do not understand why they are abusing consumers they don't help you at all This was a first step towards attempting resolution. They kept lying telling me they disputed n its not reporting but it keep reporting this inaccurate information without my authorization. They refused or were unable to verify n remove the inquiries and negative account its been 60days n they record the calls n admitted they had my police report n ftc and affidavit That was after attempting to contact Transunion more than 88 times in the last 120 days. transunion is an abusive company.

Section 1681a of the Fair Credit Reporting Act defines an investigative consumer report as a consumer report or portion thereof in which information on a consumer 's character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of the consumer reported on or with others with whom he is acquainted or who may have knowledge concerning any such items of information. They did not do this. Also they have violated my rights even more. The credit bureaus stated my account was properly investigated but how is that possible if I never gave these creditors WRITTEN CONSENT OR AUTHORIZATION TO USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OPEN OR CLOSE ANY ACCOUNT. THESE BALANCES IS IN ACCURATE, PAYMENT STATUS AND HISTORY IN ACCURATE, LAST ACTIVITY DATE IS IN ACCURATE, ALL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE NEGATIVE INSTALLMENT LOAN IS INACCURATE.Someone is using my personal information pretending to be me to obtain credit. I don't know anything about this fraudulent account. I don't have any closed OR OPEN accounts with THESE LISTED CREDITORS BELOW WITH MY DOCUMENTATION. Also they have violated my rights even more In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Everything has to be 100 % accurate on my credit report. The credit bureaus stated it was properly investigated but how is that even possible if THESE CREDITORS DID NOT GET ANY WRITTEN SIGNATURE, CONSENT OR AUTHORIZATION FROM ME. This account is fraud and does not belong to me, this is in accurate, I have never opened or closed any account with THESE CREDITORS I ask for documents with signature or authorization, they did not submit my request.This grounds for removal and deletion immediately. I never gave THESE CREDITORS ANY WRITTEN CONSENT OR AUTHORIZATION TO USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OPEN THIS ACCOUNT. THIS IS FRAUD. I'VE ASK FOR SIGNED DOCUMENTS WITH MY SIGNATURE GIVING WRITTEN CONSENT TO OPEN THIS FRAUDULENT CREDIT ACCOUNTS. SOMEONE USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION PRETENDING TO BE ME WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT TO OPEN OR CLOSE ANY CREDIT ACCOUNT WITH THESE CREDITORS BELOW They also violated the law because according to 15 U.S.C 1681 section 602 A. states i have the rights to privacy 15 U.S.C 1681 section 604 section 2 : it also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish a account without my written consent. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting act WITH THESE CREDITORS BELOW XXXX AND XXXX AND TRANSUNION has violated my rights. 15 U.S.C 1681 section 602 A.

Firstly, with regard to XXXX XXXX, the balance owed is reported as past due despite the account being closed with a XXXX balance. This indicates inadequate record keeping, and I urge you to correct this immediately. Please provide evidence to support that no false information has been reported, or remove it from my credit file. Secondly, the item reported under XXXX XXXX is inaccurate, as the account is closed with a XXXX balance, yet it is reported as past due. This is concerning and could negatively impact my creditworthiness. I request that you rectify this error without delay. Please provide proof that you have not reported false information, or remove it from my credit file. Lastly, with regards to XXXX XXXX, the account history and payment status are inaccurate. A charge-off should reflect a XXXX balance, and this misinformation is damaging to my credit. Please provide proof of the last payment made, or remove this from my credit file.\n",

I received {$60.00}. I thought I must have pressed the wrong button so I made another attempt at a withdrawal, this time in the amount of {$150.00} with a receipt. I again only received {$60.00}. I looked at my online account and it showed both transactions, {$200.00} and {$150.00} respectively. I immediately called Wells Fargo and filed a claim, explained what happened. They told me it would take up to ten days to get my money back. I followed up a couple of times and was told they are investigating. After the ten days had passed, I called the claims department on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told my claim was denied and would not be refunded. I explained to them again what happened, and I got the same response. This is unacceptable, I got robbed by the same bank that I have trusted with my money. Im not sure what else I can do. Please help me get my money back. Thank you\n",

      "complaint_what_happened Hi I am submitting this XXXX XXXX this isn't any influence and this is not a third party. TransUnion has low and unfair credit number for me in their report. I have complained more than 88 times nonstop this is exhausting im depressed they are not putting these fraudulent inquiries in dispute and accounts and they still haven't deleted them either I am depressed. The problem has not been resolved. my fico has me at a credit score over 709 transunion has me at a score around 590. That is a huge difference. transunion paints me as a Bum. my fico say I have good credit. What the heck is going on here. i have almost no debt and my identity was stolen causing my score to drop n i made this clear for 90 days straight with transunion i spoke to a representative agent name XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX  from the fraud department I prefer to speak to a us rept but they refused they had me on mute for 4 hours which was hurtful I have a perfect repayment record. I have very low credit utilization. I have one negative credit items outstanding debt now that is not mines. I have modest but ok income. Social Security. Something is wrong with Transunion. I do not understand why they are abusing consumers they don't help you at all This was a first step towards attempting resolution. They kept lying telling me they disputed n its not reporting but it keep reporting this inaccurate information without my authorization. They refused or were unable to verify n remove the inquiries and negative account its been 60days n they record the calls n admitted they had my police report n ftc and affidavit That was after attempting to contact Transunion more than 88 times in the last 120 days. transunion is an abusive company. They are supposed to be protecting consumers. They need to be reigned in. they are causing me XXXX XXXXXXXX and stopping me from getting this job offer n now im homeless n cant provide to my XXXX year old daughter PLEASE HELP ME PLEASE im depressed now.with no help they keep ignoring me after I keep telling them repeatedly they are hurting my character of my name they won't respond and it not even in investigation with and me and my son are bout to be homeless please help I cant live like this The credit bureaus never did a proper \" investigation '' according to the FCRA. Section 1681a of the Fair Credit Reporting Act defines an investigative consumer report as a consumer report or portion thereof in which information on a consumer 's character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of the consumer reported on or with others with whom he is acquainted or who may have knowledge concerning any such items of information. They did not do this. Also they have violated my rights even more. The credit bureaus stated my account was properly investigated but how is that possible if I never gave these creditors WRITTEN CONSENT OR AUTHORIZATION TO USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OPEN OR CLOSE ANY ACCOUNT. THESE BALANCES IS IN ACCURATE, PAYMENT STATUS AND HISTORY IN ACCURATE, LAST ACTIVITY DATE IS IN ACCURATE, ALL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE NEGATIVE INSTALLMENT LOAN IS INACCURATE.Someone is using my personal information pretending to be me to obtain credit. I don't know anything about this fraudulent account. I don't have any closed OR OPEN accounts with THESE LISTED CREDITORS BELOW WITH MY DOCUMENTATION. Also they have violated my rights even more In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Everything has to be 100 % accurate on my credit report. The credit bureaus stated it was properly investigated but how is that even possible if THESE CREDITORS DID NOT GET ANY WRITTEN SIGNATURE, CONSENT OR AUTHORIZATION FROM ME. This account is fraud and does not belong to me, this is in accurate, I have never opened or closed any account with THESE CREDITORS I ask for documents with signature or authorization, they did not submit my request.This grounds for removal and deletion immediately. I never gave THESE CREDITORS ANY WRITTEN CONSENT OR AUTHORIZATION TO USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OPEN THIS ACCOUNT. THIS IS FRAUD. I'VE ASK FOR SIGNED DOCUMENTS WITH MY SIGNATURE GIVING WRITTEN CONSENT TO OPEN THIS FRAUDULENT CREDIT ACCOUNTS. SOMEONE USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION PRETENDING TO BE ME WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION OR CONSENT TO OPEN OR CLOSE ANY CREDIT ACCOUNT WITH THESE CREDITORS BELOW They also violated the law because according to 15 U.S.C 1681 section 602 A. states i have the rights to privacy 15 U.S.C 1681 section 604 section 2 : it also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish a account without my written consent. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting act WITH THESE CREDITORS BELOW XXXX AND XXXX AND TRANSUNION has violated my rights. 15 U.S.C 1681 section 602 A. States I have the right to privacy. 15 U.S.C 1681 Section 604 A Section 2 : It also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish a account without my written instructions 15 U.S.C 1666B : A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose SECTION 604 15 U.S CODE 1681 B THE LAW STATES THAT NO ONE CAN FURNISH INFORMATION ON MY CREDIT REPORT WITHOUT MY CONSENT. SECTION 605 A 15 U.S CODE 1681 C-1 WITH NO WRITTEN CONSENT OR INSTRUCTIONS THAT WOULD IN FACT BE IDENTITY THEFT SECTION 605 B 15 U.S CODE 1681C A copy of section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, whichrequires you to block the.fraudulent information on my credit report resulting from identity theft within four business days and to promptly notify the furnisher ( s ) of that information.

I was told that if it was sent to a closed account, it would be returned to my XXXX account in 5 days. XXXX does not offer XXXX recalls but has provided me with the trace number for the transaction. I have spoken to Peoples United bank which merged with M & T Bank after my account was closed approximately every three days since. They have confirmed that my money has been deposited into someone else 's account at M & T Bank that does not belong to me. Every person I have spoken with has given me a different story as to why this is taking so long and I have to start over from the beginning of the story every time I call them. I have given them old addresses, account numbers, social security numbers, the actual trace number for the transaction which they have confirmed did not go to me. They refuse to let me speak to anyone in their ACH department and are now telling me I have to file with small claims court and file a police report to ( maybe ) get my money back.

      "complaint_what_happened I opened a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account with Chime on XX/XX/XXXX. This was in addition to the Checking and Savings Accounts I have with them. Every time I made a transaction, I would need to transfer money into the account first in order to use the account. On XX/XX/XXXX, deposits in the amount of {$190.00}, {$120.00}, were deposited from my Checking Account. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$60.00}, {$10.00}, and Cashback Rewards in the amount of {$2.00} were deposited. The charges were XX/XX/XXXX XXXX - - {$22.00}, - {$20.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, - {$79.00} towards my classes, XXXX Convenience Store, XX/XX/XXXX - {$80.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX, - {$10.00} Convenience, XX/XX/XXXX - - {$11.00} Convenience. On XX/XX/XXXX - - {$11.00} Convenience, - {$110.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Not Authorized ), - {$10.00} XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged {$110.00}! On the statement, it shows only the charges from XX/XX/XXXX and it only shows the deposits of {$120.00} and {$190.00} = {$320.00}! This is in the deposit account and was not reflected as my available balance! In XXXX, deposits were taken from my direct deposits and put into the deposit account for the XXXX XXXX XXXX Account, which was not authorized, in the amount ( according to their third statement for the same time ) + {$1300.00} ( {$320.00} + {$1000.00} ) and they charged the erroneous amount of XXXX which, as mentioned previously, I could not possibly owe. This continues into XXXX where {$1200.00} was charged for a secured account that I had to transfer money into for use. In XXXX, XXXX, it shows that the balance in the deposit account on XX/XX/XXXX was {$1200.00} ( should have been {$1300.00} ), plus an additional {$300.00} deposited. Then, they charged {$1200.00} ( that I did not owe ) with {$310.00} still in the deposit account. Their math is not even correct because it would have been {$300.00} that remained. So, the total I should not have been charged and is owed at this point is {$2900.00}. In XXXX, XXXX, a total of {$5000.00} was deposited into the deposit account without authorization, bringing the amount they owed at this point to {$8000.00}! I did not receive credit for refunds or errors/disputes they made either. This statement was changed multiple times and I have each statement. In XXXX, XXXX, I no longer was using this account and no new transactions took place. However, the statement claims that I spent {$1400.00}! The only activity that took place was my being refunded in the amount of {$980.00}, which should have actually been {$1200.00} for fraudulent XXXX charges which I won the dispute regarding. Furthermore, an additional {$1000.00} was charged to me on XX/XX/XXXX for a supposed balance of {$2300.00} ( on the third statement ). An additional {$76.00} was deposited into this account which is far less than what actually was and so that brings the total they owe to {$10000.00}! They charged me {$1400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when absolutely no transactions were made. They went on to charge {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when no transactions were made and {$59.00} on XX/XX/XXXX when again no transactions were made. {$10000.00} is the total they have fraudulently stolen from me.\n",

These inquiries were made without my knowledge or consent, and I believe that they were done in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 USC 1681b, which governs the permissible purposes of consumer reports. \n",

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX According to the FCRA, consumer reports may only be used for certain permissible purposes, such as in connection with a credit application, employment screening, or insurance underwriting. However, I never gave permission for my credit report to be published for any of these purposes, nor did I extend credit to anyone who would require such a report. \n",
      "Therefore, I believe that these hard inquiries were made without my permissible purposes and should be removed from my credit report immediately. I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and would like to request that you provide me with written confirmation of the removal of these inquiries from my credit report. \n",

I XXXX the company.. called them and they said my address was not the one on file.. I explained I never applied for nor had a card with them..they sent me to the fraud dept. I explained to the fraud rep the situation and he was very rude I asked what I needed to do and could I have the account number and the address to put in the police report he stated no.. that is private info and hung up. I reported the fraud to Experian and disputed the info... I received notice that they verified the account and it is accurate.. It is NOT accurate, it is not mine ..this is fraud/ My credit monitoring does not show any credit card approved for this lender.. no inquiry nothing until the late payment was reported. I check they date it says the card was opened which would show on my credit monitoring. I had my credit file locked at the time this shows it was opened so no credit cards should be able to be issued if my credit file is locked. I can prove this with my experian account. I need help to have this resolved and taken off my report. Also, the company that issued it is still showing the account active and open despite 3 calls informing them it was stolen identity and fraudulent.\n",

Furthermore, XXXX mailed me a letter dated XX/XX/2023, stating that on XX/XX/2023 XXXX credited {$51.00} back to my credit card, and on XX/XX/2023 XXXX credited {$19.00} back to my credit card.

The representative explained that it was supposed to be processed as a credit so the two credits ( {$51.00} and {$19.00} ) would sum to a credit of {$70.00}. Basically, the charge should have been a credit, and I will be receiving two {$19.00} credits now on my next statement in XX/XX/2023- she apologized for this mistake and gave me a second case number. \n",

      "complaint_what_happened I currently receive credit card paper statements from a particular bank for a specific reason. However, I feel that the bank that has provided the credit is indirectly forcing me to select electronic statements by not allowing me to few my statements online. I have contacted the bank today, XX/XX/2023, and asked why I am not given the option to view my statements online without having to enroll in electronic statements? The representative apologized and stated that he would send me the statement via email within 24 to 48 hours. The other credit card companies that I currently have accounts with does not limit my access to the online statements because I have not enrolled in electronic statements. This bank is not consumer friendly and is not giving the consumer the option to view their statements online without having to enroll in electronic statements. If I need to view a past statement for financial reasons, I will have to wait to receive it in the mail or call them and complain about this matter in order for them to send it to me by email, which is not convenient because I will have to wait as opposed to being able to see it immediately.\n",

      "complaint_what_happened US bank is asking to verify my account since there are fraud anomalies on my account. One I haven't used my card for anything except for groceries or gas but that was a month ago. because I am paying off the card this year. They are asking me to send them my personal bank statements, tax forms, social security card, and other info such as DL via mail. I wouldn't mind sending my DL, but send my social security card, tax forms, and bank statements in the mail. I keep calling to get to the bottom of this, every single time I call so far every representative hangs up the phone when I asked if I can omit some info from my bank statements/tax form since I have had my identity stolen before. Plus they can not tell me why they need my statements or why they need to see what I am spending in my daily bank account. This has nothing to do with my credit card. Nor will they give me a fax number to send in the documents. This is sooooo unfair and very unprofessional and I just want to rectify the situation. The employees need to be trained better on how to handle the situation.\n",

I entered into a deferement program with wells fargo due to being unemployed from COVID-19 related illnesses. Upon attempting to restart my payments a wells fargo employee told me \" you do not have a choice in what program you use. '' i would get no explanation as to why i HAD NO CHOICE. after fighting back and forth with wells fargo and being threatened with foreclosure multiple times i reluctantly signed their paperwork so my family and i wouldnt be homeless. \n",
      "\n",
      "i was told by a wells fargo employee when i started the deferement program that the VA disaster relief fund would take all my missed payments and add them in months to the end of the loan. my apr would not change and my monthy payments would not change. \n",
      "\n",
      "when i tried to come out of deferement i was told by a wells fargo employee \" you do not have a choice in what program you use. '' When i initially bought my house i had a loan for XXXX dollar in XXXX i made near 7 years of mortgage payements. after finishing this entire ordeal with WELLS FARGO and their criminal practices my new mortgage was RESTARTED AT 360 MONTHS, my APR went up close to 7 % and my monthly payments are close to {$2300.00} now. my monthly payment the day prior to deferement was XXXX. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the ordeal of preventing WELLS FARGO from putting my family and me out on the street and stealing my house i made THREE PAYMENTS AT XXXX, totaling XXXX dollars. i asked a wells fargo employee \" where did that money go? '' and NEVER GOT A STRAIGHT ANSWER. that money went into somoenes pocket just like my near 7 years of mortgage payments. \n",

I then called freecreditreport.com to get a credit report sent as Experian was not help in identifying why my credit score change so drastically with no indication of any negative reported. XXXX and XXXX got my credit report to me via US Mail promptly. I still see nothing to change my credit report as Experian did. I have yet to hear back after over three months about getting my credit report from Experian in the mail. I then complained via CFPB XXXX and XXXX. I then sent a letter to Experian asking for my credit report once again XX/XX/XXXX. I have found no answer and no credit report. I have called at least two dozen times but Experian has not be willing to send a credit report or even say why they have not. On XX/XX/XXXX Experian again manipulated my credit score down by XXXX points. I complained again via CFPB XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have called Experian three times in the past week. Twice the Experian representative said they transfer me to a mysterious department to get a credit report sent and then they hung up on me. The other time the Experian representative said they would elevate the issue but I have not heard anything back from Experian for over a week. I have went above and beyond requesting a credit report in every why Experian claims to request one. Experian is in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act when they have not provided a credit report or even attempted to provide feedback as to why they have refused to provide one after Experian and only Experian has decreased my credit score. Even the people at FICO have said they have nothing negative on their reporting.\n",

In order to prevent the money from being stolen, I was told to wire the {$9100.00} in the account to myself. My full name and information were on the wire account. This Wells Fargo person had all of our personal information ; social security numbers, passwords, home address, and had already moved money between accounts to consolidate the amount stolen. Once we realized what happened i contacted WF immediately to prevent this theft. I was put on hold and told they would file a case. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I was told our case was denied and WF would not recover our stolen money. My account was not even set up for wire transfers, and the money went to someone XXXX dont know in a state I dont go to or know anyone. This transaction should have been flagged immediately. I can not even take more than a couple XXXX dollars from an ATM, why would they allow {$9100.00} to be instantly wired and not contact me? Wells Fargo did nothing to protect me or my money, then denied my claim and said it was my fault. As a large banking institution it was their responsibility to refund my stolen {$9100.00} and go after the thief. They have insurance to handle these fraudulent transactions but just declined my claim rather than assist a victim of theft/fraud. I was kicked when I was down by a company that should have protected me, or in the least make some effort to try.\n",

When I did try doing that, the agent from the Chase credit card company told me because the fraud department has closes dispute in the favor of Marriot I have to pay that amount and they can not help me open another dispute or else I have to write a letter and mail it to them and then they will decide whether they can open a dispute or not. I firmly believe that this is unjustly trying to make me pay for some thing that I didn't authorize on my card. As I paid the full balance of my stay with Marriott with my another card, and this card was just used for identification purposes which shouldn't be charged with any kind of fee or payment as I have the proof that I paid the full amount with my another Chase credit card. I informed them regarding what I am saying here, but they are not ready to listen to my side of the story and not opening another dispute and unjustly trying to ask me to pay the amount.\n",

The check ended up being a fake check and when I was transferring money from that check, it ended up bouncing back to me which meant that it deducted from my own bank account instead. It ended up costing me {$4400.00} as I first transferred out {$2500.00} followed by {$1900.00}. The check was fake as the check information was invalid.

      "complaint_what_happened I received a cashback deposit from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX i received a mobile banking alert that my balance was now {$0.00}. When i went to log it to see what was going on i was advised my account was closed. I inquired via chat and via phone call as to why my account had been closed with no warning. Both times i was told they they would not discuss the reason with me and i would just have to wait for something in the mail. I did not commit any banking violations and Wells Fargos outright refusal to even explain the reason for the closure is outrageous. A month ago they had a technical issue that left me with a negative balance although i had just received my paycheck via XXXX. Im not understanding how a company who will erase all trace of peoples hard earned money is about to steal money from consumers and close their accounts at will and refuse to give a reason why. Furthermore, when i opened this account it was incentivized by a {$300.00} bonus that was to be credited to my account after making direct deposits adding up to at least {$1000.00} within the first 90 days that i had done within the first 2 weeks of account opening and now i am being told that on top of the unexplained closure, i also no long qualify for the incentive that was promised even after i had completed all requirements which is text fraudulent activity. Wells Fargo must be held accountable for the harm they have caused and continue to causes consumers.\n",

I then made the payment again a couple weeks later to cover the missing money so my service wouldnt be interrupted. They never gave me my {$200.00} in my bank account nor did the take the amount off of my bill. Then a couple months later I canceled phone lines with a XXXX XXXX XXXX representative on the phone but they continued charging me for cellular data for one phone that wasnt even being used on their services anymore, Ive contacted them on several accessions to try and resolve these issues but I keep getting the run around. I even recently spoke with a rep and said I wanted to start services back up again then they started acknowledging the problem but still not giving a proper solution.

However, this explanation appears to be implausible as payment can not be scheduled without a verified account on file. It is important to note that a payment can not be scheduled without a verified account on file, which leads to the suspicion that my account was deleted by the Wells Fargo system after I scheduled the payment with a verified account.\n",

To this day over 60 days later I have not received a response yet. feel like i'm being taken advantage of and being ignored of my disputes. Section 611 ( a ) it is plainly stated that failure to investigate these items within 30 days gives a reason to immediately remove those negative items from my credit report as well as correct my late payments as aid on time. It has been over 60 days so they should be corrected promptly. I demand the pese negative accounts be deleted & correct late payments as paid on time immediately or I will file for litigation due to the stress you caused me.

      "complaint_what_happened I'm a XXXX year old semi-retired XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from your Claims Assistance Center stating that my fraud claim regarding an online advance totaling {$9900.00} on my credit card ending in XXXX had been denied. It went on to state Our research shows the advance was made through a secure online banking session by you or someone who had your authority and that no other processing errors occurred. Based on this information, we determined the advance was authorized. We have closed your claim. \n",
      "\n",
      "The actual fraud, however, involved more than a simple advance on my credit card. Your banks subsequent efforts to correct the damage have messed up my account balances almost beyond recognition and have proven your inability to sort out what really happened. If you dont understand what happened, it would logically follow that you wouldnt discern that a fraud took place. All three of my Wells Fargo accounts ( checking, savings and credit card ) were involved in fraudulent activity, with unauthorized transactions occurring on all three. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fraud occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. My computer was attacked by a virus that locked my screen and displayed a pop-up warning from XXXX that my computers would be locked if I didnt call XXXX at XXXX ( see exhibit 1 - attached screen shot ). When I called the number, I was instructed to download some software to enable the agent to connect to my computer and check it out. Giving access via software downloads is a normal practice when you work with any technical support group. The agent ran some programs that appeared to show me that my computer was infected by viruses and under attack by someone trying to hack my computer, but that my XXXX warranty would allow them to fix it for free if I would first purchase a software license that they would reimburse me for. \n",
      "\n",
      "To prove that I wouldnt have to pay, they offered to transfer the reimbursement to my account in advance if I would give them the account number. I expected they might transfer perhaps XXXX or XXXX XXXX dollars when I gave them my checking account number ( there was only about {$150.00} in it at the time ). I was stunned when I checked the account on my phone and saw {$2000.00}. I thought there might be something suspicious going on but now I thought I was in possession of {$2000.00} that didnt belong to me that I needed to get out of my account. They then told me I would have to buy gift cards and read them the numbers on the back so that they could pay for the license. \n",
      "\n",
      "I then told them I would check my saving account to make sure they didnt simply transfer the {$2000.00} I had there to my checking. In fact this is exactly what they had done without my authorization, however, unknown to me, they quickly transferred the {$2000.00} back to savings ( again without my authorization ) so I would see it there. They next transferred {$9900.00} from my credit card ( without authorization ) to my checking account, then transferred {$8000.00} back to my credit card ( again without my authorization ) leaving an unauthorized {$2000.00} in my checking account. Consequently, when I checked again, I could see both my intact {$2000.00} in savings and another {$2000.00} in checking, which I assumed was their money. I had not thought of checking my credit card since I dont think Id ever even used it ( it had a XXXX balance at the time ) and couldnt imagine how they would get access to it even had that thought occurred to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "In any event, at this point I had {$2000.00} in my account that I was positive didnt belong to me. Was this legit or were these people manipulating me to launder money. I couldnt be sure, but I was certain I needed to purge it from my account. Consequently, I did as I was told and withdrew the {$2000.00} ( which was the result of an unauthorized charge on my card and unauthorized transfer to checking ) from my checking account at my local branch. I then purchased XXXX {$500.00} XXXX gift cards at XXXX and read them the numbers from the back of the cards. \n",
      "\n",
      "That night I woke up in the middle of the night convinced that I had been the victim of a fraud. I called Wells Fargo when I saw the transactions on my credit card and reported the fraud and changed my passwords. I also reported the fraud to the Internet Crime Complaint Center ( IC3 ). These actions should provide proof that I wasn't trying to defraud Wells Fargo. My quick action in alerting Wells Fargo saved your company from paying out on thousands of dollars worth of transactions that had been charged to my card during the night. I didnt bother reporting to the local police as the fraudsters could have been located anywhere in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "The reason Im appealing your decision is that none of the transactions that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX were authorized by me with the possible exception of the cash withdrawal from the local branch. However, even that was a withdrawal of funds that were fraudulently placed in the account. Im attaching photocopies of the gift cards with the numbers on the back scratched off. Wells Fargo should have red flagged the fact that a credit card account, that had never been used, suddenly got maxed out. Why wasnt I alerted with a text message? Why wasnt the teller who gave me the cash alerted that there was an unusual transaction on my account. Had she asked me if I had withdrawn the maximum {$10000.00} from a credit card, that had never previously been used, that day I would have realized I was being scammed and wouldnt have withdrawn the funds. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequent Events When I received the denial letter, I checked my accounts and found that I had a {$2000.00} charge left on my credit card. I called the number on the letter to ask that you send me documentation of the reason my claim was rejected. A sympathetic rep told me to hold off and she would see if she could get the claim decision reversed. In the meantime, I had withdrawn most of my funds from my accounts since I feared they might be garnished. I was delighted to find that on XX/XX/XXXX a set of reversal transactions had been entered to credit my charge for {$9900.00} plus interest charges. I assumed my appeal had been successful. However, my accounts now showed that you owed me {$8000.00} instead of me owing you {$2000.00}. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few days later, while I was on vacation in XXXX XXXX XXXX, I called you long distance to try to sort things out. I spent an hour on the phone being switched from one person to another until I got connected to someone who I believe was in the fraud unit. They said that they would file a report to eliminate the {$8000.00} that I was credited in the account. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, when I checked again a little over a week ago, I found that someone had posted a debit of {$9900.00} to my checking account while I still had the {$8000.00} credit on my charge card. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried calling again ( I called XXXX ) and was again bounced around to several people including a XXXX and a XXXX and was given a reference number ( XXXX ). It seems some people can access my checking account, others can access my credit card, but no one can make a correction to both. The last person I spoke with ( didnt catch the name ) finally said that I owe {$2000.00} and thats it ''. Then she hung up on me. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the fraud claim is resolved properly with my claim being completely granted, my accounts should have the following balances 1. Business Checking {$60.00} 2. Business Market Rate Savings - {$4.00} 3. Business Card {$0.00} I would prefer not to have to cancel my accounts and my relationship with your bank but will be forced to do so if my claim isnt granted. \n",
      "\n",
      "On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed an appeal packet to the address displayed on a Wells Fargo Appeal Request Form I downloaded via a XXXX search. It was returned to me as \" not deliverable as addressed '' on XX/XX/XXXX.\n",
